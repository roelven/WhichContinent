h2. A MySQL table to map all countries on their respective continents

After searching for a proper API hook somewhere to retrieve the continent of a specific country, I decided to map them in a table myself and use this for my applications.

*example:*

|_. id|_. country_code|_. country|_. continent_code|_. continent|
|1 |AF | Afghanistan |3 |Asia |
|2 |AL | Albania |2 |Europe |
|3 |DZ | Algeria |5 |Africa |

etc.
